1.The topology shows the network inside a university. The university has received "161.200.0.0/16" network. Since the number of hosts for each network is different, you'll divide the IP address into different sizes. Use VLSM technique to assign IP address to each network.


a.
Network 1 has 32,000 hosts.
Network 2 has 16,000 hosts.
Network 3 has 8,000 hosts.
Network 4 has 4,000 hosts.
Network 5 has 2,000 hosts.
Network 6 has 1,000 hosts.
Network 7 has 500 hosts.
Network 8 has 250 hosts.

VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) Calculation Formula: `2^n - 2 ≥ number_of_hosts`; n = #hosts-bits, #network-bits = 32-#hosts-bits

Subnet Mask 32-bits: 255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
IP Address: 192.168.1.10, network part: 192.168.1, host part: 10

Network 1 needs 32,000 hosts.
2^15 = 32,768 -> usable(-2) = 32,766 -> hosts bits = 15,
network bits = 32-15 = 17 -> subnet mask = 11111111.11111111.10000000.00000000 = 255.255.128.0
Base network: 161.200.0.0/16
Network Address/CIDR = 161.200.0.0/17
First Usable Address = Network Address + 1 = 161.200.0.1
Broadcast Address = Network Address + 2^15 - 1 = 161.200.127.255

Network 2 needs 16,000 hosts.
2^14 = 16,384 -> usable(-2) = 16,382 -> hosts bits = 14,
network bits = 32-14 = 18 -> subnet mask = 11111111.11111111.11000000.00000000 = 255.255.192.0
Network Address:
Network 1 already used:
161.200.0.0 – 161.200.127.255 (/17)
= 161.200.0|0000000.00000000 - 161.200.0|1111111.11111111
So the next block starts at: 161.200.10000000.00000000 = 161.200.128.0
First Usable Address = Network Address + 1 = 161.200.128.1 = 161.200.10|000000.00000001
2^14=16,384=256*"64" -> 161.200.128.0 + 64 blocks = 161.200.(128 + 64).0 = 161.200.192.0
Broadcast Address = Network Address + 2^14 - 1 = 161.200.191.255

Network | Number of Host IPs | Network Address / CIDR | First Usable Address | Broadcast Address
Network 1 | 32,000 | 161.200.0.0 /17 | 161.200.0.1 | 161.200.127.255
Network 2 | 16,000 | 161.200.128.0 /18 | 161.200.128.1 | 161.200.191.255
Network 3 | 8,000 | 161.200.192.0 /19 | 161.200.192.1 | 161.200.223.255
Network 4 | 4,000 | 161.200.224.0 /20 | 161.200.224.1 | 161.200.239.255
Network 5 | 2,000 | 161.200.240.0 /21 | 161.200.240.1 | 161.200.247.255
Network 6 | 1,000 | 161.200.248.0 /22 | 161.200.248.1 | 161.200.251.255
Network 7 | 500 | 161.200.252.0 /23 | 161.200.252.1 | 161.200.253.255
Network 8 | 250 | 161.200.254.0 /24 | 161.200.254.1 | 161.200.254.255


b.From number of hosts described in previous bullet, subnet "161.200.0.0/16" network using VLSM technique to assign appropriate subnet mask to each subnet. Use the first subnet id for each network and use the second subnet id for dividing next network.

c.For network 1 to 8, assign first host IP address for router gigabit interface, second host IP address for host. If there are more than 1 host, assign less IP to the host which character comes first.

d.Network 9 to 16 are serial link, and create one more subnet which has the same size as Network 9 to 16 for NAT. We call the last network as Network 17.

Each serial link:
just 2 hosts (1 IP per router), total IPs = 4 (2 usable IPs+broadcast+network)
2^n - 2 >= 2 -> n = 2 -> network bits = 32-2 = 30 -> subnet mask = 255.255.255.252/30 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100

e.Continue subnetting the first subnet of each new subnet until you have appropriate subnet mask to assign to each network.

f.For network 9 to 16, assign first host IP address to the router that has less number.

g.For private network, we use private class A IP address.
